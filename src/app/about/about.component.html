            About Me
                HI, MY NAME IS IMane

                And Pinch of Yum is my little corner of the internet!

                I'm the voice, author, and creator behind Pinch of Yum. What started as a casual hobby for nights and weekends while I was working as a fourth grade teacher has now grown into a full-blown business (!!) that reaches millions of people with fun recipes each month.

                I live in Saint Paul, MN with my husband Bjork and our dog Sage. My favorite things in life are a big plate of pad Thai, sunny days, and going to the dog park.
